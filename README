This is intended to be a useful guide for real-world communication difficulties
between neurodivergent (Autism, ADHD, etc.) and neurotypical (Allistic) people.

While I do not wish for this work to become inaccessible to those without
means, I do also feel the need to ensure that my work does not get misused, or
used in a for-profit endeavour where I do not have a reasonable share in that
endeavour.

As such, I grant no license to copy or redistribute this work in any form
without express written permission by myself. Said permission will be readily
forthcoming for reasonable requests - you just need to ask.
